## Chords

A chord is a combination of **three or more** different pitches played simultaneously. Chords are typically named by their root note and their quality (major, minor, diminished, augmented, etc.).

C major chord - Root position is when the name of the chord is the lowest tone on the chord. The thumb is on the lowest tone.

C major chord - `1 3 5`

> Contrast with triad: Triad, in music, a chord made up of **three tones**, called chord factors, of the diatonic scale: root, third, and fifth. The system of diatonic triads is the basis of tonal harmony in music

> Triad, subset of chord?

Diatonic triads are chords built from each note of the diatonic scale, using only the notes within that scale. For the C major scale, the diatonic triads are as follows:

C major (C, E, G)
D minor (D, F, A)
E minor (E, G, B)
F major (F, A, C)
G major (G, B, D)
A minor (A, C, E)
B diminished (B, D, F)
